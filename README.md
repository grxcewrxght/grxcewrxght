### **Hi there, I'm Grace 👋**
##### Pronouns: *she/her*

#### *About Me 👩🏻‍💻✨*

👨‍🏫 Recent **Data Engineering** graduate. Currently in search of opportunities to work in **Data Science/Engineering**
- 💭 I have deeply enjoyed designing ETL pipelines and optimising data processing workflows, and hope to carry this work out further in future roles. I have experience working in diverse, collaborative environments, and I excel at effective communication. With everything I've learned, I'm excited to actively contribute to shaping data-driven strategies that drive business growth and explore innovative solutions. I hope to collaborate more in future works to help consolidate my knowledge and harness/expand my skillset even further.

✏️ **Python** / **SQL** / **Bash** / **Powershell**

🔧 Firsthand experience with industry related technologies: **AWS** (**IAM, MSK, MWAA, EC2, RDS, Kinesis**) / **Apache Kafka** / **Apache Spark** / **Databricks** / **PgAdmin4** / **PostgreSQL**

🗿 Before taking on the world of tech, I completed an undergraduate degree in **Anthropology**. Throughout my time at university, we explored human past, present, and future. Bit by bit, I developed an observant interest as to where we have to go for the future as a collective, and believe that data and AI are the way forward. 

🎉 Fun Fact(ish): I love learning and trying new things. I'm always looking for new hobbies to take on. Currently I enjoy **watercolouring** and practicing my **Spanish** to get it back up to a respectable level. Let me know what you [enjoy](https://7mlgkmm0bfd.typeform.com/to/WgFopfp6)!
